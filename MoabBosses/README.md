### Moab Bosses Mod
**BTD6 MOD HELPER REQUIRED**  

• To use the mod, download MoabBosses.dll into your mods folder, then run the game.  
• Once you boot into the game, it will prompt you to pick a boss bloon to replace all moab class bloons.  
• Type in the boss name (ex. Bloonarius), then hit enter. All moab class bloons will now be replaced with that boss.
